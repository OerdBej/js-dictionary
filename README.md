# ðŸš€ JavaScript Dictionary ðŸ’›

This Dictionary app was developed solely with vanilla JavaScript, providing an opportunity to enhance my JavaScript skills by deepening my understanding of DOM manipulation and the utilization of fetch and catch error functionalities. Additionally, the implementation of the Font Awesome CDN library was utilized in this project. To simulate the server environment for this mini project, I integrated the JavaScript API from Free Dictionary API, allowing for access to and storage of object data.
