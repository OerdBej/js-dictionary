# ðŸš€ JavaScript Dictionary

This is a Dictionary app that is written only in vanilla JavaScript. This project helped me to understand better how the DOM manipulation works in JavaScript and how to work with the fetch and catch erorr. For this project I have also used FontAwesome cdn library. In order to simulate the server in this mini project I have used the JavaScript API provided by Free Dictionary API in order to access and store the object data.
